# Ars Venefici

Ars Venefici is a Stardew Valley mod that adds the ability to craft and cast spells with a spell book!

The functionality for the spell making is a port of the spell making functionality from the [Ars Magica Legacy Mod for Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-magica-legacy) to C# (Ported with permission).
Took inspiration from the [Ars Nouveau mod for Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ars-nouveau) to make spells using a spell book format.

Some functionality for some spell parts is based on some spells from the [Magic mod by spacechase0](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2007). 
The cutscene of the wizard giving you a spell book is also based on the learning magic cutscene from the magic mod.
